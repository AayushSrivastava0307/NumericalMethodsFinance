Binomial European Model Implementation
To successfully compile and run the Binomial European Model:

1. Ensure Compatibility
Use the latest versions of BinModel, Options, and Main.
These files are available in the NewModels directory for the most up-to-date implementation.
2. Avoid Old Models
If you're referencing legacy files from the OldModels directory, ensure you update them to match the latest standards before compiling.
The old versions may lack recent features, optimizations, or bug fixes.
Why Choose This?
Efficiency: Implements optimized numerical methods for faster and reliable computations.
Accuracy: Built on robust mathematical foundations tailored for financial modeling.
Modular Design: Simplifies extensions and experimentation.
